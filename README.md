# simple-rest-api-platform
A simple RESTful service to serve as a platform to help learn API testing.

## Background
You want to learn automation testing, learn about Swagger, or simply want to start out learning how to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).  Where do you start, and what can you test against while you are building your skills?
Here is a "simple-rest-api-platform" that you can use to test against, which provides useful basic functionality with no heavy dependencies like databases, servers, hosting, etc, and instead provides an easy-to-use, self-contained, documented RESTful API Platform.
